# Sachin_ODI_Stats Analysis

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Sachin Tendulkar's One Day International (ODI) cricket statistics. Various statistical techniques such as z-test, chi-square test, ANOVA, etc., are employed to gain insights into different aspects of Sachin's performance. The analysis covers aspects like first innings vs second innings, performance in different countries, and more.

## Dataset

You can manually download the dataset from the following link: [Sachin_ODI_Stats Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oJbdRpTLqPu1SIBXHkzWRaLaZbvZot7w/view?usp=sharing)

## Techniques Used

- **Z-Test**: Utilized for hypothesis testing to compare Sachin's performance metrics.
  
- **Chi-Square Test**: Applied to analyze the independence of categorical variables in the dataset.
  
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: Used to compare means across different groups, providing insights into performance variations.

## Aspects Explored

1. **Innings Analysis**: Comparison of performance in first innings vs. second innings.
  
2. **Country-wise Performance**: Evaluation of Sachin's stats in different countries.
  
3. **Statistical Significance**: Determination of statistically significant differences and trends.

## Feature Engineering

- **Derived Metrics**: Creation of additional metrics to enhance analysis.
